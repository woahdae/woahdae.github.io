AI will either make maintainable coding techniques obsolete, or critically important.

I will be farming, or gainfully employed and writing about it.

### Projects

Currently CTO at [InPlay](https://www.inplay.org/), serving 500k+ parents, students, and school districts.

See also [i•v•e love](https://ivelove.com), a small sideproject about my favorite
prioritization technique - Impact vs Effort matrices.

### Career

I've spent 20 years mostly at startups keeping Rails monoliths maintainable and
productive, except a brief stint doing big-company app development and Erlang.
