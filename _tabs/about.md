I've spent 20 years keeping Rails monoliths maintainable and productive. Currently CTO at [InPlay](https://www.inplay.org/) serving parents, school districts, and students. AI will either make architecture obsolete or critically important. I will be farming, or gainfully employed and writing about it.
